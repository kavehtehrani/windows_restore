# windows_restore

Script to restore layout once a remote session (e.g. VPN) ends on Windows.
Stores layout of windows (enabled and visible) and saves down the state.
Once the VPN ends it restores to the last layout saved before the VPN began.

I wrote this little script since I was tired of moving my windows around while
using VPN to my PC since the resolutions are usually not the same
